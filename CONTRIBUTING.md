## Best Practices

* Be careful when using/passing/storing credentials.
* Code for Windows, MacOS, and Linux users.
* Use git shallow clone/fetch.
* Use Promises API. Avoid blocking/sync calls.
* Use logging framework. Avoid `console.log()` and `console.dir()`.
* Avoid unecessary dependencies to 3rd party modules.
